                    LSTMs consist of chained, repeating modules. At a high level, what are the two pieces of information that is passed between modules?
                </b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The information that between modules are past outputs and past states. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>
                    "LSTM" stands for "Long Short Term Memory". The name is a reference to a problem with RNNs that LSTMs are designed to solve. 
                    What is this problem? At a high level, how do LSTMs attempt to address this problem (what extra information do they add)?
                </b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The problem is that RNNs cannot learn long term dependencies. LSTMs attempt to address this problem by remembering cell state.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>
                    The blog post describes two views of RNN/LSTM architectures. In one of these views, we think of the RNN as being "unrolled" into a chain of repeating modules. 
                    What values (represented with tensors) are shared between these modules, and what values are different? 
                </b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       The values that are shared between these modules are the parameters. The values that are different betweent the modules are the cell states, intermediate inputs, and intermediate outputs. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>
                    Think about the ranges of the output - what is the property of sigmoid's output range that makes it work for our purpose when we multiply with the current state vector?
                </b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ReLU's output range is between 0 and infinity. We want to use sigmoid's output range because it's between 0 and 1, which means that 0 is forget all while 1 is remember all.

                    Run the model for 10 to 15 epochs, or until you see interesting results. Pause the model and record the perplexity. Perplexity is a measurement of how well 
                    the model predicts a sample. A low perplexity indicates that the model is good at making predictions.

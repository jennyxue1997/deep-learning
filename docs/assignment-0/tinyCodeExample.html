<!-- 
    Changes: 
    - changed the scalar to 2000 and its multipliers to [2, 4, 6] instead of [1, 2, 3] 
    - changed title of page to A very fun deepleanjs page
    - changed result to be 4000, 8000, 12000

    structure from Tensorflow.js.  The computation
    runs on the computer's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit),

    difference is irrelevant for this tiny example, but will
    become critical for compute-intense applications like

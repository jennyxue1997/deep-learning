                    1) What is the reward scheme for FrozenLake?
                </b></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The reward scheme is 0 for falling and 1 for reaching the goal.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    2) How big is the table used for Q-learning above?
                </b></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Numbers of values in action space x number of values in observation space = 16 * 4 = 64. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>
                    3) Did the rewards improve over time? Why or why not? 
                </b></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Yes. From the RewardsList we can see that the values are mostly 0.0 in the beginning and became mostly 1.0 towards the end. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>
                    4) In the above code segment, we provided some values for the learning rate and discount factor. 
                       Try different values for the learning rate. What do you observe?
                </b></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Lowering the learing rate to 0.1 drastically worsens the result. Increasing the learning rate to 1 also drasticall worsens the result. From testing all learning rates between 0 and 1 in 
                    intervals of 0.01, I found that 0.68 was the best learning rate with 1474 1.0s.

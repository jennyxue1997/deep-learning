                    Do the different digits separate into distinct clouds? Are there images that are in the wrong cloud, and can you make sense of why they are wrong? Are there images that are outliers from the rest of the data? 
                    Are there digits that seem more separate from the others, and are there pairs of digits that are more easily confused?

                        The different digits separate into distinct clouds. As you can see from the examples that I have attached, the distinction is clearly seen in the different colored clouds, for example 6 and 0. However, you 
                        can also spot many 5's separating from the 5 cloud and blending in even to the 0 cloud. The reason that they are in the wrong cloud could be because of many reasons. First, I only ran the simulation for about 200 iterations, which means 
                        that it's not trained enough. Secondn, the way these 5's are written connects the bottom circle, which makes them resemble 0s.

                        0 and 1 are very separated while the highlighted 0 & 2, 0 & 6, and 4 & 9 are more easily confused.

                        frequently appeared with violin.

                    Experiment with various words to see if you can identify any insights about the data set. For example, try “politics” along the dimension from “bad” to “good”, or 
                    “engineer” along the spectrum from “man” to “woman”. Write up some notes on your observations, perhaps supplemented with a few pictures. Do you get different or better 
                    results if you use Word2Vec All instead of 10K? Did you find any interesting examples that speak to how words are used news articles? Write up what you experimented with 
                    and what conclusions you drew.

                        The two images show "engineer" along the dimension from "man" to "woman" and also the neighbor "soldier." The left image is of Word2Vec 10K and the right image is of Word2Vec All. Overall there are no major differences between 10K and All, the words are mostly still on the same "side"
                        of the spectrum (right or left). In 10K, soldier is more frequently associated with woman while in All, solider is more towards the middle (associated frequently with both). This is because there are more words which means there could be additional relationships that are formed between words. Both wordsets
                        are able to depict the innate bias in "engineer", that society associates engineers with men more often than women. There's not really "better" results.

However, further testing needs to be done to support this hypothesis.

                        Find 10 fonts for a specific quality (i.e. bolding, dotting, fancy, serif...etc) and average them out to find a characteristic vector (for example, “bolding vector”). 
                        Try applying that vector to another font. Again, you can do this by manual computation and then modifying the added vector in the "Apply Vector Math" button, or you can make new buttons. 
                        Does it work better or worse than the previous one-sample method? Try this with at least 2 characteristics.

                        Find 10 fonts the exhibit for a specific characteristic and 10 fonts for the opposite of that characteristic (i.e. bold vs. corresponding non-bold). Subtract 
                        the vectors for each pair and take the average difference. How does this work as a vector for the characteristic (e.g., as a "bolding vector")?  
                        Does this work better or worse than the method above to obtain your desired characteristic? Try this with at least 2 characteristics.

                        Extra bold (bold - non bold): Adding this vector to a font creates a extra bold version of the font. It doess this relatively well. The slantedness carries over but the dots are too big to be seen.

                        Can you figure out how to create a vector that makes uppercase fonts lowercase? (Hint: You can try finding fonts that only have uppercase/lowercase characters and finding analogous vectors, or you can try playing with the 40 attribute sliders directly.

                        I found 10 very different looking (italics, bold, bubbly, etc) lower case fonts, averaged them then subtracted twice that from the selected font. This worked less well on skinnier fonts than bold fonts.
